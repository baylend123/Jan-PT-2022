/***********************************************************************
Welcome to The Article Company! At AC, you have been tasked with a
very important job! Your boss says we need more articles about Spiderman!
But, uh-oh! Some of the writers did not write articles about Spiderman.
You have been given a long string that contains a list of every writer,
and a value that shows if they have written an article about Spiderman.
You must write a function, 'spiderManWriters(string)' and convert its contents
to an object that "ONLY" contains key value pairings of writers who did "NOT"
write about Spiderman.

Assumptions:
You may assume that the order of the key value pairs in the object does NOT matter.

Examples:

str1 = 'Angela T: wrote about Spiderman, Miah B: no Spiderman, Adrian R: wrote about Spiderman'
str2 = 'Tom B: no Spiderman, Justin N: no Spiderman, Emily B: wrote about Spiderman'
***********************************************************************/

function spiderManWriters(string) {
    const array = string.split(', ');
    const obj = {};

    for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
        const current = array[i];
        if(current.includes('no Spiderman')){
            let name = current.split(':')[0];
            obj[name] = 'no Spiderman';
        }
    }
    return obj;
}
